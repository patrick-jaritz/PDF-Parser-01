## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Components Involved**
1. **SimplifiedDashboard.tsx** - Main interface with Tesseract integration
2. **TesseractProcessor.tsx** - Handles local OCR processing with progress
3. **tesseractOCR.ts** - Core Tesseract.js logic for PDF/image processing
4. **useDocumentProcessor.ts** - Hook with processWithExtractedText method

### **Processing Flow**
```
File Upload
  ↓
Tesseract Selected?
  ↓ Yes
Show TesseractProcessor
