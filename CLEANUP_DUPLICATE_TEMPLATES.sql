-- ============================================================================

-- Delete duplicate templates, keeping only the most recent one for each name
DELETE FROM structure_templates
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      id,
      name,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name, is_public ORDER BY created_at DESC) as rn
    FROM structure_templates
    WHERE is_public = true
  ) as ranked
  WHERE rn > 1
);

-- Verify: Show count of each template name
SELECT 
  name,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  MAX(created_at) as latest_created
FROM structure_templates
WHERE is_public = true
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY name;

-- âœ… Done! Duplicates removed. Each template should now appear only once.
