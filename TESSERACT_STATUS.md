# Tesseract Status Update

## ✅ Great News: Tesseract OCR is Working!

The local OCR extraction is completing successfully! The issue is now in the LLM structuring stage.

---

## 🎯 What's Happening

### **Working:**
✅ Tesseract selection (no more blocking alert)
✅ File upload
✅ Template selection  
✅ TesseractProcessor appears
✅ Local OCR processing completes
✅ Text extraction successful

### **Issue:**
⏳ Gets stuck at "Structuring Data - Organizing extracted text into structured format"

This means the call to the `generate-structured-output` Edge Function is hanging.

---

## 🔍 **Possible Causes**

### **1. API Keys Not Configured**
The Edge Function tries to call OpenAI/Anthropic/Mistral APIs. If no API keys are configured, it should return demo data, but this might be slow or timing out.

### **2. Network/CORS Issues**
The fetch request to the Supabase Edge Function might be blocked or timing out.

### **3. Edge Function Error**
The function might be throwing an error that's not being caught properly.

---

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied**

### **Added Debug Logging**
✅ Console now shows:
- "Calling LLM Edge Function..." with details
- "LLM Response received: 200" when successful
- Helps identify where it's stuck

### **Added Timeout**
✅ 2-minute timeout added to prevent infinite hanging
✅ Will show error if Edge Function doesn't respond

---

## 🧪 **How to Test/Debug**

### **Test 1: Check Browser Console**
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
2. Process a document with Tesseract
3. After OCR completes and you click "Process Document"
4. Look for:
   ```
   Calling LLM Edge Function... { jobId: "...", llmProvider: "openai", textLength: 1234 }
   ```
5. Wait up to 2 minutes
6. Should see either:
   - "LLM Response received: 200" (success)
   - Timeout error (if hanging)

### **Test 2: Check Network Tab**
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
2. Process document with Tesseract
3. Look for request to: `/functions/v1/generate-structured-output`
4. Check:
   - Status: Should be 200
   - Response: Should have structuredOutput
   - Time: How long it takes

### **Test 3: Try Different LLM Provider**
1. In Advanced Settings, select "Anthropic" or "Mistral Large"
2. Try processing again
3. See if different provider works better

---

## 💡 **Quick Workaround**

### **Option A: Check API Keys**
If you're an admin:
1. Go to `/admin/test-api-keys`
2. Check if OpenAI, Anthropic, or Mistral keys are configured
3. If not configured, the Edge Function should return demo data (might be slow)

### **Option B: Use Different OCR Provider**
1. Try Google Vision or another cloud OCR provider
2. See if structuring works with those
3. This helps isolate if issue is specific to Tesseract workflow

### **Option C: Check Edge Function Logs**
If you have Supabase dashboard access:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Edge Functions → Logs
3. Look for errors in `generate-structured-output` function
4. Check for timeouts or API errors

---

## 🚀 **Expected Timeline**

With Tesseract workflow:
- **OCR Processing**: 10-60 seconds (local, depends on file size)
- **LLM Structuring**: 5-30 seconds (cloud API call)
- **Total**: ~15-90 seconds

If it's taking longer than 2 minutes, something is wrong.

---

## 📊 **Current Status**

**What Works:**
- ✅ Tesseract selection
- ✅ File upload
- ✅ Local OCR processing
- ✅ Text extraction

**What's Stuck:**
- ⏳ LLM structuring (hanging/timing out)

**Likely Cause:**
- Edge Function call not completing
- API keys might be missing
- Network timeout

---

## 🔧 **Immediate Actions**

1. **Check Console** - Open DevTools and look for errors
2. **Wait 2 Minutes** - See if timeout triggers (will show error)
3. **Check Network Tab** - See if request is pending or failed
4. **Try Old Interface** - Compare behavior

---

## 📞 **Next Steps**

Please check the browser console and tell me:
1. What appears in console when you click "Process Document" after Tesseract completes?
2. Does it show "Calling LLM Edge Function..."?
3. Does it ever show "LLM Response received: 200"?
4. Are there any error messages?

This will help me pinpoint the exact issue!
